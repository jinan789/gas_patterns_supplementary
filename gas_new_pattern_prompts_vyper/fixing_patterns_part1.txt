I want you to help me fix some errors in the given gas-wasting patterns for Solidity. Those patterns are what I have just found, and I have been informed by an expert of some potential issues associated with the patterns I found. Now, I need you to help me make the corrections based on the feedback from the expert, and give me an improved version of the patterns that I found.

To begin with, I want to tell you a high-level idea of gas optimization. Each instruction in the code sequence consumes a certain amount of gas based on their operation types, which costs money. If we could find an equivalent code instruction sequence that produces the same output while consuming less gas, then this would save money for Solidity users.

Next, I will give you my patterns, followed by the feedback on improvement.

First, the list of gas-wasting patterns is given below. The list is numbered, with each bullet point specifying one gas-wasting pattern, which is followed by an explanation of why this pattern wastes gas. These are the patterns that I found:
