### New Gas-Wasting Patterns Found

#### Pattern: Inefficient Use of Storage for Dynamic Values

1. **Discovery Process:**
   - I observed that variables like `tokensForSwapping`, `tokensForMarketing`, `tokensForDev`, and `tokensForLiquidity` are frequently updated and their values used only during specific transactions (e.g., in `swapBack()`).
   - Since these values change often and do not need to persist beyond a single transaction, using persistent storage results in unnecessary SSTORE operations, which are costly.
   - The introduction of transient storage (EIP-1153 and EIP-7609) provides an opportunity to optimize by using TSTORE for temporary changes.

2. **Fix Steps:**
   - Refactor the contract to use transient storage for `tokensForSwapping`, `tokensForMarketing`, `tokensForDev`, and `tokensForLiquidity`.
   - Change the storage declarations from `uint256 tokensForSwapping` to `uint256 transient tokensForSwapping`.
   - Update all interactions with these variables to use `TSTORE` and `TLOAD` instead of `SSTORE` and `SLOAD`.
   - This change reduces the cost because `TSTORE` and `TLOAD` are cheaper for variables that do not need to persist post-transaction.

3. **Impact Rating:**
   - Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4
   - This approach slightly reduces readability because developers need to understand the use of transient storage, but it does not compromise security or significantly affect maintainability.

### Reflection on the Task and Improvements

- **Prompt Clarity:**
  - The prompt could benefit from specifying the frequency and context in which certain variables are updated or accessed. This would help identify more specific optimization opportunities.
  - Include more details about transient storage upfront to guide the analysis better, especially for those unfamiliar with recent EIPs.

- **Improving Reasoning Process:**
  - Initially, I focused on typical patterns without fully leveraging the unique aspects of transient storage introduced by EIP-1153 and EIP-7609.
  - A deeper initial analysis of the specific functions and their operations could have led to quicker identification of optimization opportunities.
  - By understanding the lifecycle and usage pattern of variables better, more targeted optimizations can be suggested.

- **Implemented Improvement:**
  - I expanded the analysis to consider the lifecycle of variables (`tokensForSwapping`, `tokensForMarketing`, etc.), which are reset and recalculated frequently. This led to the identification of using transient storage as an optimization.
  - I explained the reasoning behind recommending transient storage, emphasizing its cost-effectiveness for temporary data, which aligns with the latest EIP functionalities.

This approach ensures that the analysis is not only thorough but also practical, focusing on significant gas savings without compromising the contract's integrity or the clarity of the code.
