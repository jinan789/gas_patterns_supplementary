### New Gas-Wasting Patterns Identified

#### Pattern: Inefficient Use of Storage for Frequently Updated Variables
1. **Identification Process:**
   - In Solidity, storage operations (read and write) are very costly in terms of gas. The contract code shows multiple instances where `applications[_tick]` is accessed multiple times for reading and writing within the same function. This is particularly evident in the `addVote` and `cancelVote` functions.
   - Each access incurs significant gas costs. Additionally, since the data is frequently updated, using permanent storage may not be the most efficient choice.

2. **Solution Steps:**
   - Consider storing frequently updated data structures in transient storage if their lifecycle is limited to a single transaction. This is especially true for data that does not need to persist beyond the transaction that is processing.
   - Convert the storage type of `applications[_tick]` from a permanent storage to a transient storage using the new TSTORE and TLOAD operations, provided by EIP-1153 and EIP-7609.
   - Modify function implementations to use TSTORE for updates and TLOAD for reads in the context of a transaction.

3. **Impact Score:**
   - **Readability:** 4 (Minor decrease due to the introduction of new concepts of TSTORE and TLOAD)
   - **Security:** 5 (No impact on security as transient storage only changes the storage duration)
   - **Maintainability:** 4 (Maintainability slightly decreases as developers need to manage two types of storage, but the structure remains largely the same)

### Improvements and Reflections

1. **Prompt Clarity:**
   - The prompt could benefit from specifying the size and frequency of transactions expected for the contract. This information would help in deciding whether transient storage is beneficial overall or if the overhead of managing two storage types outweighs the benefits.
   - Including specific performance metrics or gas costs for current implementations could help in quantifying the potential benefits of the suggested optimizations.

2. **Reflection on Reasoning Process:**
   - Initially, the approach was to look for patterns directly mentioned in the prompt. However, considering the unique features of Solidity and the specifics of the EVM, including transient storage, helped in identifying broader and more impactful optimization opportunities.
   - In future analyses, starting with an overview of the specific technologies and features available (like transient storage) before diving into the code can provide a more structured approach to identifying inefficiencies.

3. **Improvement Implementation:**
   - Expanded the scope of analysis beyond the provided patterns by considering the specific features of the EVM and recent EIPs.
   - This approach was necessary to fully leverage the capabilities of Solidity and the EVM in terms of gas optimization, moving beyond conventional programming patterns and focusing on blockchain-specific optimizations.

By focusing on these aspects, the analysis not only adheres to best practices in Solidity development but also leverages new features to achieve significant gas savings, thereby reducing operational costs and improving contract efficiency.
