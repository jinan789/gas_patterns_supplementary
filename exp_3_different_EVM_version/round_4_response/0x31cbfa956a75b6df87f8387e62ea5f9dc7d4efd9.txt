Analyzing the provided Solidity code and considering the nuances of transient storage under EIP-1153 and EIP-7609, I've identified several potential inefficiencies and gas-wasting patterns not covered in the initial list. Below, I elaborate on these patterns and suggest possible optimizations.

### New Gas-Wasting Patterns Identified

#### 1. **Redundant Recomputation of Square Root Prices**
- **Pattern Identification**: In multiple functions (`tokenAmountsToLiquidity`, `tokenAmountsToMaximalLiquidity`, `calculateTvlByMinMaxPrices`), the square root prices are recomputed every time these functions are called (e.g., `TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick`). This is inefficient if the tick values (`tickLower` and `tickUpper`) do not change often.
- **Optimization Steps**:
  1. Utilize transient storage to cache the square root prices if the tick values remain unchanged between transactions.
  2. Modify the function to check if the required square root prices are already available in transient storage before recomputing them.
  3. Save the computed square root prices back to transient storage if they are not already present.
- **Impact Rating**: Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. This enhancement maintains readability and security but slightly complicates the code with transient storage handling.

#### 2. **Inefficient Use of Storage in Loop and Conditional Operations**
- **Pattern Identification**: In the `calculateCakePriceX96InUnderlying` function, the `poolForSwap` variable is fetched from memory each time but could potentially benefit from transient storage optimization if the `poolForSwap` address remains constant across frequent calls.
- **Optimization Steps**:
  1. Check if `params.poolForSwap` is frequently the same across calls within the same transaction.
  2. If yes, store `poolForSwap` in transient storage at the beginning of the transaction.
  3. Retrieve `poolForSwap` from transient storage instead of re-declaring it in each function call.
- **Impact Rating**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. This approach utilizes transient storage effectively without significantly impacting the code's readability or security.

#### Reflection on the Task and Improvement Suggestions

**Task Completeness:**
- **Analyzing the Code**: I examined the provided code for common patterns and inefficiencies, focusing on opportunities for transient storage optimization.
- **Pattern Identification**: Identified new patterns based on potential redundant computations and inefficient use of storage.

**Improvements for Next Time:**
- **Broader Context Consideration**: I could enhance the analysis by considering the broader application context, such as how frequently certain data changes or the typical transaction patterns.
- **More Detailed Examples**: Providing more concrete code examples for suggested optimizations could help illustrate the changes more clearly.

**Suggestions for Future Prompts:**
- **Detailed Application Context**: More information about the typical usage patterns and data volatility could refine the analysis.
- **Specific Performance Metrics**: If available, specific performance metrics or gas usage statistics could help prioritize which optimizations are most impactful.

**Adjustments Made This Time:**
- **Provided Concrete Steps for Optimization**: To ensure clarity, I detailed the steps required to implement the suggested optimizations.
- **Consideration of Transient Storage**: I tailored my suggestions to leverage new EIP features, specifically transient storage, which is crucial for optimizing state-intensive operations in Solidity.

By refining these aspects, future analyses can be more targeted and effective in optimizing Solidity code for gas efficiency.
