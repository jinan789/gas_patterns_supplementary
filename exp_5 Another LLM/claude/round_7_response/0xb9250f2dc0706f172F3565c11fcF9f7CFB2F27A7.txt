Here are some potential new gas-wasting patterns I found in the provided Solidity code:

1. \textbf{Inefficient string comparison}: In the \texttt{newVote} function, the comparison \texttt{bytes(\_tick).length < 6} converts the string \texttt{\_tick} to a byte array just to check its length. It would be more gas-efficient to store the length of \texttt{\_tick} in a separate variable and compare against that.

Reasoning:
- Step 1: Noticed the \texttt{bytes(\_tick).length < 6} comparison in \texttt{newVote}.
- Step 2: Recognized that converting a string to a byte array just for a length check is inefficient.
- Step 3: Realized that storing the length in a variable would avoid the unnecessary conversion.

To fix:
- Step 1: Declare a variable to store the length, e.g. \texttt{uint tickLength = bytes(\_tick).length;}  
- Step 2: Replace the comparison with \texttt{tickLength < 6}
- This avoids the unnecessary repeated conversion of \texttt{\_tick} to bytes.

Ratings: 
- Readability: 5 (no significant impact)
- Security: 5 (no impact) 
- Maintainability: 4 (very minor impact from extra variable)

2. \textbf{Redundant storage reads}: In the \texttt{addVote} function, \texttt{applications[\_tick]} is read multiple times to access different fields like \texttt{expireAt}, \texttt{totalVotes}, etc. Reading from storage is expensive, so it would be more efficient to read \texttt{applications[\_tick]} into a memory variable once and then access its fields.

Reasoning: 
- Step 1: Noticed multiple accesses to \texttt{applications[\_tick]} in \texttt{addVote}.
- Step 2: Recognized that \texttt{applications} is a mapping, so \texttt{applications[\_tick]} is a storage read.
- Step 3: Realized that caching \texttt{applications[\_tick]} in memory would reduce redundant expensive storage reads.

To fix:
- Step 1: Declare a memory variable to store the application, e.g. \texttt{Application memory app = applications[\_tick];}
- Step 2: Replace all instances of \texttt{applications[\_tick].field} with \texttt{app.field}
- This reduces the number of expensive storage reads.

Ratings:
- Readability: 4 (minor impact from extra variable) 
- Security: 5 (no impact)
- Maintainability: 4 (minor impact from extra variable)

Regarding the prompt, I think it provides sufficient background information and clear instructions. The only potential improvement could be to specify whether the code is from a single function/contract or multiple ones, as that affects the analysis scope.

To improve my own reasoning process, I could:
- Put more emphasis on analyzing the data locations (storage vs memory) of variables, as that significantly impacts gas costs. I've added an extra step in the reasoning above to reflect this.
- Consider the frequency/likelihood of each code path executing. Gas optimizations in frequently called functions or highly likely code paths will have a larger impact. I didn't fully factor this in above.
- Analyze how the gas costs scale with input size or as the contract state grows over time. Some inefficiencies may have a larger impact in certain scenarios. I didn't consider this scalability aspect in depth.

Let me know if you have any other questions! Gas optimization can involve complex tradeoffs between readability, maintainability, security and gas costs, so it often requires careful analysis and iterative improvements.
