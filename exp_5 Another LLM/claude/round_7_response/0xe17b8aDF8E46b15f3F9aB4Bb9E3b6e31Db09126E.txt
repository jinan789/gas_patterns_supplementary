Here are some new gas-wasting patterns I found in the provided Solidity code, along with answers to your questions for each pattern:

1. \textbf{Inefficient use of \texttt{require} statements}: The code uses multiple \texttt{require} statements to check conditions sequentially. If any of the conditions fail, the function will revert and consume all the gas up to that point. A more gas-efficient approach would be to combine the conditions into a single \texttt{require} statement.

   - Finding this pattern: I noticed that the \texttt{transfer}, \texttt{transferFrom}, \texttt{approve}, \texttt{increaseApproval}, and \texttt{decreaseApproval} functions all have multiple \texttt{require} statements that check similar conditions (e.g., checking if addresses are frozen). By combining these checks into a single \texttt{require}, we can save gas by avoiding unnecessary checks if an earlier condition fails.

   - Fix: Combine the conditions of multiple \texttt{require} statements into a single \texttt{require}. For example, in the \texttt{transfer} function, change:
     \begin{verbatim}
     require(_to != address(0), "cannot transfer to address zero");
     require(!frozen[_to] && !frozen[msg.sender], "address frozen");
     require(_value <= balances[msg.sender], "insufficient funds");
     \end{verbatim}
     to:
     \begin{verbatim}
     require(_to != address(0) && !frozen[_to] && !frozen[msg.sender] && _value <= balances[msg.sender], "invalid transfer");
     \end{verbatim}
     This way, if any condition fails, the function will revert early, saving gas.

2. \textbf{Redundant storage reads}: The code reads the same storage variables multiple times within a function, which can be costly in terms of gas. Storing the value in a memory variable and reusing it can save gas.

   - Finding this pattern: I noticed that in the \texttt{decreaseApproval} function, \texttt{allowed[msg.sender][_spender]} is read twice: once to store its value in \texttt{oldValue} and again in the \texttt{if} condition. By storing the value in a memory variable, we can avoid the second storage read.

   - Fix: Store the value of a storage variable in a memory variable and reuse it. For example, in the \texttt{decreaseApproval} function, change:
     \begin{verbatim}
     uint oldValue = allowed[msg.sender][_spender];
     if (_subtractedValue > oldValue) {
     \end{verbatim}
     to:
     \begin{verbatim}
     uint oldValue = allowed[msg.sender][_spender];
     if (_subtractedValue > oldValue) {
         allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = 0;
     } else {
         allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = oldValue.sub(_subtractedValue);
     }
     \end{verbatim}

Prompt Improvement:
- The prompt is clear and provides a good amount of information. One suggestion would be to include the version of Solidity being used, as gas optimizations may vary between versions.

Self-reflection and Improvements:
- In my reasoning process, I focused on identifying patterns that involve unnecessary or redundant operations, as well as opportunities to reduce storage reads and writes. I could improve by also considering the gas costs of specific opcodes and exploring more advanced optimization techniques, such as using assembly for certain operations.
- Based on this reflection, I would add the following improvement to my output:

3. \textbf{Using assembly for certain operations}: In some cases, using Solidity's inline assembly can lead to gas savings compared to the high-level Solidity constructs. For example, the \texttt{betaDelegatedTransfer} function uses assembly to load the signature components, which is more gas-efficient than using Solidity's built-in parsing functions.

   - Finding this pattern: The use of assembly in the \texttt{betaDelegatedTransfer} function caught my attention. Assembly allows for more fine-grained control over the EVM and can lead to gas savings when used correctly.

   - Fix: Identify performance-critical sections of the code and consider using assembly for those parts. However, be cautious as assembly is low-level and can introduce security risks if not used properly. Always thoroughly test and audit assembly code.

   - Ratings: Readability: 2; Security: 3; Maintainability: 2

   This improvement highlights the potential gas savings from using assembly, but also emphasizes the trade-offs in readability, security, and maintainability.
