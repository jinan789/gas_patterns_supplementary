Here are some potential new gas-wasting patterns I identified in the provided Solidity code, along with my reasoning process and suggestions for fixing them:

1. \textbf{Unnecessary function parameters:} The \texttt{donateERC20} function takes several parameters (\texttt{\_token}, \texttt{\_tokenSymbol}, \texttt{\_amountInDesired}, \texttt{\_to}, \texttt{\_message}, \texttt{\_merkleProof}) and immediately assigns them to variables without any checks or modifications. This wastes gas by requiring the values to be passed in and stored, even though they could be directly used. 

To fix this, remove the unnecessary parameters and use the original variable names directly:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Solidity]
function donateERC20(
    address token,
    string calldata symbol,
    uint256 amountInDesired,
    address to,
    bytes calldata message,
    bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
) external nonReentrant {
    // ...
}
\end{lstlisting}

Readability: 5, Security: 5, Maintainability: 4

Reasoning process:
- Noticed that the function parameters were immediately assigned to variables with the same names
- Recognized this as an unnecessary step that wastes gas on storage and assignments
- Realized the parameters could be used directly, eliminating the need for the extra variables

2. \textbf{Inefficient string to bytes32 conversion:} The \texttt{stringToBytes32} function uses inline assembly to convert a string to bytes32. However, this is inefficient because it requires loading the entire string into memory. A more gas-efficient approach would be to use \texttt{abi.encodePacked} and \texttt{keccak256}.

To fix this, replace the \texttt{stringToBytes32} function with the following:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Solidity]
function stringToBytes32(string memory source) private pure returns (bytes32 result) {
    result = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(source));
}
\end{lstlisting}

Readability: 4, Security: 5, Maintainability: 4

Reasoning process:
- Noticed the use of inline assembly for string to bytes32 conversion
- Recalled that inline assembly is generally less efficient than high-level Solidity constructs
- Realized that \texttt{abi.encodePacked} and \texttt{keccak256} could achieve the same result more efficiently
- Suggested replacing the function with a more gas-optimal implementation

Prompt improvement: The prompt was clear and provided sufficient information to identify gas-wasting patterns. One potential improvement could be to provide more context about the overall purpose and functionality of the contract, which might help identify additional optimization opportunities.

Self-reflection: To improve my reasoning process, I could:
1. Spend more time analyzing the code holistically to identify patterns across multiple functions
2. Consider the impact of gas optimizations on the contract's overall functionality and security
3. Provide more detailed explanations of why certain patterns waste gas and how the proposed fixes improve efficiency

Based on this reflection, I would add the following to my output:

3. \textbf{Redundant require statements:} The \texttt{donateToken} and \texttt{donateERC20} functions both contain the require statement \texttt{require(from != to, "The donor address is equal to receive")}. This check could be moved to a separate internal function to avoid duplicating the require statement and the associated gas costs.

To fix this, create a new internal function:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Solidity]
function _checkFromNotEqualTo(address from, address to) internal pure {
    require(from != to, "The donor address is equal to receive");
}
\end{lstlisting}

Then, replace the require statements in \texttt{donateToken} and \texttt{donateERC20} with calls to \texttt{\_checkFromNotEqualTo(from, to)}.

Readability: 4, Security: 5, Maintainability: 4

This improvement is necessary to reduce code duplication and associated gas costs, making the contract more efficient and maintainable.
