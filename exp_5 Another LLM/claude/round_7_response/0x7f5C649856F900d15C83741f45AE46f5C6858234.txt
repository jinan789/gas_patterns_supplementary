Thank you for the detailed prompt and the example gas-wasting patterns. I have analyzed the provided Solidity code and identified the following new gas-wasting patterns:

\begin{itemize}
\item Unnecessary storage reads in loops: In the \texttt{lock} function, the \texttt{COUNTRY\_LIST.countryIsValid(params.countryCode)} check is performed within the function body. If this check is expected to pass for most cases, it could be more gas-efficient to perform the check before the function call and revert early if the condition is not met. This avoids unnecessary storage reads within the function.

\begin{enumerate}
\item I found this pattern by examining the code and identifying storage reads that are performed within loops or function bodies. I considered whether these reads could be moved outside the loop or function to save gas.
\item To fix this pattern, you can move the \texttt{COUNTRY\_LIST.countryIsValid(params.countryCode)} check before the \texttt{lock} function call. If the check fails, you can revert early, avoiding the need to execute the function body. This works because it eliminates the storage read within the function, which saves gas.
\item Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4
\end{enumerate}

\item Inefficient event emission: In the \texttt{addOrEditFee} function, the \texttt{onAddFee} and \texttt{onEditFee} events are emitted separately based on a conditional check. Emitting events is relatively expensive in terms of gas. Instead, consider using a single event and pass a boolean parameter to indicate whether it's an addition or edit.

\begin{enumerate}
\item I found this pattern by looking for event emissions within conditional statements. I considered whether the events could be combined to save gas.
\item To fix this pattern, you can define a single event, such as \texttt{FeeUpdated}, that includes a boolean parameter to indicate whether it's an addition or edit. Then, emit this event unconditionally with the appropriate boolean value. This works because it reduces the number of event emissions and eliminates the conditional check.
\item Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4
\end{enumerate}

\item Redundant storage writes: In the \texttt{lock} function, the \texttt{newLock} struct is created and its fields are assigned values. However, some of these fields, such as \texttt{nftPositionManager} and \texttt{pool}, are already available in the function parameters. Instead of assigning them to the struct fields, you can directly use the parameter values when emitting the event.

\begin{enumerate}
\item I found this pattern by examining the code and identifying storage writes that assign values already available in memory or function parameters. I considered whether these writes could be avoided to save gas.
\item To fix this pattern, you can directly use the parameter values instead of assigning them to the struct fields. For example, instead of \texttt{newLock.nftPositionManager = params.nftPositionManager}, you can use \texttt{params.nftPositionManager} directly when emitting the event. This works because it eliminates unnecessary storage writes.
\item Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

Regarding your prompt, it provides a clear explanation of gas optimization in Solidity and includes a helpful list of known gas-wasting patterns. The code snippet you provided is sufficiently complex to allow for the identification of new patterns. One suggestion for improvement could be to provide a bit more context about the purpose and functionality of the specific contract and functions, as this could help in understanding the code better and identifying potential optimizations.

In terms of my reasoning process, I tried to think beyond the listed patterns and consider other aspects of Solidity that could impact gas consumption, such as storage reads/writes, event emissions, and conditional statements. I also considered the trade-offs between gas optimization and factors like readability, security, and maintainability.

To improve my response, I could have provided more detailed explanations of why the identified patterns are gas-inefficient and how the proposed fixes achieve gas savings. Additionally, I could have included code snippets to illustrate the suggested changes more clearly.

Overall, I believe the patterns I identified, along with the provided explanations and improvement suggestions, address the task requirements effectively. However, there may be additional gas-wasting patterns that could be discovered with further analysis and a deeper understanding of the contract's specific use case and requirements.
