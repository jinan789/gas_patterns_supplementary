Here are some potential new gas-wasting patterns I identified in the provided Solidity code:

\begin{itemize}
\item Unnecessary storage reads in loops: In the \texttt{\_check\_merkle\_tree} function, the \texttt{merkle\_root\_hash} mapping is read from storage in every loop iteration, even though the value doesn't change. It would be more gas-efficient to read it once before the loop and store it in a memory variable.

1. I found this pattern by analyzing the code line by line and considering whether each storage read was necessary. The \texttt{merkle\_root\_hash} mapping read stood out as unnecessary since the value is constant within the function.

2. To fix this, declare a memory variable before the loop to store the \texttt{merkleRoot} value:
\begin{verbatim}
bytes32 memory merkleRoot = merkle_root_hash[airdrop_hash];
\end{verbatim}
Then use \texttt{merkleRoot} instead of \texttt{merkle\_root\_hash[airdrop\_hash]} inside the loop. This avoids the unnecessary repeated storage reads.

3. Readability: 5, Security: 5, Maintainability: 4. The fix improves gas efficiency without significantly impacting readability or security. Maintainability is slightly reduced since the extra variable needs to be managed.

\item Unnecessary storage writes: In the \texttt{\_finalize\_airdrop} function, the \texttt{projects} mapping is updated even if \texttt{current\_drop.is\_eth} is false. Writing to storage is expensive, so this write operation could be avoided in that case.

1. I identified this by considering each storage write and whether it was always necessary. Updating \texttt{projects} when the airdrop uses tokens instead of ETH seemed unnecessary. 

2. To fix this, wrap the \texttt{projects} update in an \texttt{if} statement:
\begin{verbatim}
if (current_drop.is_eth) {
    projects[project_id].eth_balance += refund;
}
\end{verbatim}
This skips the unnecessary storage write when the airdrop uses tokens.

3. Readability: 4, Security: 5, Maintainability: 4. The added conditional slightly reduces readability and maintainability, but not significantly. Security is unaffected.

\item Unnecessary SLOAD operations: Some storage variables like \texttt{DEAD} and \texttt{UNISWAP\_ROUTER\_ADDRESS} are repeatedly loaded even though their values don't change. Storing them in memory variables would avoid the repeated SLOAD operations.

1. I noticed these variables being used multiple times and realized their values are constant, so the repeated storage loads are wasteful.

2. Declare memory variables for these constants at the beginning of relevant functions:
\begin{verbatim}
address memory dead = DEAD;
address memory router = UNISWAP_ROUTER_ADDRESS;
\end{verbatim}
Then replace occurrences of \texttt{DEAD} and \texttt{UNISWAP\_ROUTER\_ADDRESS} with the memory variables.

3. Readability: 5, Security: 5, Maintainability: 4. This optimization has minimal impact on readability and security. Maintainability is slightly reduced due to the extra variables.

\end{itemize}

To improve the prompt for next time, you could specify what kinds of new patterns to look for (e.g. focused on storage, loops, etc.). This would help guide the analysis.

In terms of reasoning, I think I could improve by:
1) Doing an initial pass to identify the most expensive operations, then scrutinizing those areas more closely. 
2) Considering gas costs more quantitatively by looking up the actual gas prices of different operations.
3) Analyzing how often different code paths are likely to be hit, to prioritize optimizing the most common paths.

I've made some small improvements to the explanation of the first pattern, noting that the merkle root value is constant within the \texttt{\_check\_merkle\_tree} function, which is key to why the repeated storage reads are unnecessary. This extra detail clarifies the reasoning behind the optimization.
