Here are some potential new gas-wasting patterns I identified in the provided Solidity code:

1. \textbf{Repeated reads of storage variables in a loop}: In the \texttt{initReserves} function, the \texttt{\_pool} variable is read from storage in each iteration of the loop. This could be optimized by caching the value in a local variable before the loop.

To find this pattern, I looked for loops in the code and checked if any storage variables were being read repeatedly inside the loop. Caching storage reads in a local variable is a common gas optimization technique.

To fix this, you could modify the code to:

\begin{verbatim}
IPool cachedPool = _pool;
for (uint256 i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    ConfiguratorLogic.executeInitReserve(cachedPool, input[i]);
}
\end{verbatim}

By reading \texttt{\_pool} once before the loop and using the cached value inside, you avoid repeated expensive storage reads.

2. \textbf{Redundant checks in mutually exclusive conditionals}: In several functions like \texttt{setReserveBorrowing} and \texttt{setReserveStableRateBorrowing}, there are require statements checking mutually exclusive conditions in if-else blocks. These checks could be moved outside the conditional to avoid redundant checks.

I identified this by looking for if-else statements and checking if the conditions were mutually exclusive and if the same checks were being performed in both branches.

For example, in \texttt{setReserveBorrowing}:

\begin{verbatim}
if (!enabled) {
    require(!currentConfig.getStableRateBorrowingEnabled(), Errors.STABLE_BORROWING_ENABLED);
}
currentConfig.setBorrowingEnabled(enabled);
\end{verbatim}

Could be refactored to:

\begin{verbatim}
require(enabled || !currentConfig.getStableRateBorrowingEnabled(), Errors.STABLE_BORROWING_ENABLED);
currentConfig.setBorrowingEnabled(enabled);  
\end{verbatim}

This avoids the redundant check when \texttt{enabled} is true.

3. \textbf{Repeated storage writes in mutually exclusive conditionals}: Similar to the previous pattern, in the \texttt{configureReserveAsCollateral} function, the \texttt{liquidationBonus} is set in both if and else blocks. This could be moved outside the conditional.

I found this by looking for variables being written in both if and else blocks of a conditional.

\begin{verbatim}
if (liquidationThreshold != 0) {
    // ...
} else {
    require(liquidationBonus == 0, Errors.INVALID_RESERVE_PARAMS);
    // ...
}
currentConfig.setLiquidationBonus(liquidationBonus);
\end{verbatim}

Could be refactored to:

\begin{verbatim}
if (liquidationThreshold == 0) {
    require(liquidationBonus == 0, Errors.INVALID_RESERVE_PARAMS);
    // ...
}
currentConfig.setLiquidationBonus(liquidationBonus);  
\end{verbatim}

This moves the storage write outside the conditional, avoiding a redundant write.

The prompt was clear and provided sufficient information to analyze the code for gas optimizations. To improve my analysis, I could have:

1. Looked for more opportunities to cache storage variables, even outside of loops. 
2. Considered if any of the require checks could be precomputed or simplified.
3. Checked for dead code or unreachable statements that could be removed.

I've updated the examples to include more detailed explanations of the reasoning process and gas optimization techniques. Let me know if you have any other questions!
