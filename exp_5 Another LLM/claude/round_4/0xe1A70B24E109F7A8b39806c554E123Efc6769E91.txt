I want you to help me find new gas-wasting patterns for Solidity. Gas is a unique pricing mechanism in Solidity, which measures the amount of computational resources put into the execution of Solidity codes. The goal of gas optimization is to find an equivalent code instruction sequence that produces the same output while consuming less gas, which may misalign from the way people typically write codes, since code writers aim for readability and maintainability, while gas optimization might seem a little unintuitive to newcomers. For example, storage variables in Solidity are expensive in terms of gas, while memory is not, so storage operations should be avoided whenever possible. Gas is paid in real money, so saving gas is saving money.

First, I will give you a list of known gas-wasting patterns. The list is numbered, with each bullet point specifying one gas-wasting pattern, which is followed by an explanation of why this pattern wastes gas. I want you to read through these and learn how to find new gas-wasting patterns from it. The list is as follows:

1. "dead codes." codes that are guaranteed not to be executed (e.g. unreachable conditional branch) should be removed.
2. "Opaque predicate." If the outcome of a predicate could be inferred to be true/false without execution, then we could just replace it with the corresponding value to save the compuation during runtime.
3. "Expensive operations in a loop." If an gas-expensive operation is executed multiple times in a loop, while there is a way to equivalently move it out of the loop to execute only once (e.g. storing a storage variable in a memory variable and performing operations on the memory variable inside the loop), then we should do it to save gas.
4. "Constant outcome of a loop." If the outcome of a loop could be inferred without execution, then we could just replace it with the corresponding value to save the compuation during runtime.
5. "Loop fusion." If two loops have the same starting and stopping conditions with the same increment steps, then we could consider combining them into one (e.g. delete the second loop, and put its loop body codes into the first one) if they have no dependencies. This way, we save the logical comparisons, conditional jumps, as well as the incremental steps of the second loop, which saves computation and thus gas.
6. "Repeated computations in a loop." If there are expressions that produce the same outcome in each iteration of a loop, we could move it out of the loop and execute only once, which saves computation.
8. "Struct variable refactoring." If a struct used in a contract contains some fields that are used more often and some that are less often, then by breaking up the struct into two, where the frequently used fields are now put as a separate struct, we get to avoid unnecessary reads on the less often used fields and save gas.s

Next, I will give you a chunk of Solidity codes from which you will find gas-inefficient patterns; note that I have removed simple functions from the contract and only kept complex ones, with the hope that you could focus on the most complicated function codes:contract LSDai is Ownable, ILSDai {
  function initialize(uint256 _depositCap, uint256 _interestFee, uint256 _withdrawalFee, address _feeRecipient)
    external
    returns (bool)
  {
    if (_initialized) {
      revert LSDai__AlreadyInitialized();
    }

    // Transfer ownership to message sender
    _transferOwnership(msg.sender);

    // Set ERC20 name and symbol
    name = "Liquid Savings DAI";
    symbol = "LSDAI";

    // Set initial deposit cap to 10m DAI
    setDepositCap(_depositCap);
    // Set fee information
    setFeeRecipient(_feeRecipient);
    setWithdrawalFee(_withdrawalFee);
    setInterestFee(_interestFee);

    _initialized = true;

    // Setup the LSDAI contract to be able to interact with the MakerDAO contracts and DAI token
    vat.hope(address(daiJoin));
    vat.hope(address(pot));
    dai.approve(address(daiJoin), type(uint256).max);

    return true;
  }


  function setInterestFee(uint256 fee) public onlyOwner {
    // Cap at 5% (500 basis points)
    if (fee > 500) {
      revert LSDai__InterestFeeHigh();
    }

    interestFee = fee;

    emit InterestFeeSet(fee);
  }

  function setFeeRecipient(address recipient) public onlyOwner {
    if (recipient == address(0)) {
      revert LSDai__FeeRecipientZeroAddress();
    }

    feeRecipient = recipient;

    emit FeeRecipientSet(recipient);
  }

  function getSharesByPooledDai(uint256 daiAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
    // Prevent division by zero
    if (_totalPooledDai == 0) {
      return daiAmount;
    }

    return daiAmount.mul(_totalLsdaiShares).div(_totalPooledDai);
  }

  function getTotalPotSharesValue() external view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 chi = (block.timestamp > pot.rho())
      ? (RMath.rpow(pot.dsr(), block.timestamp - pot.rho()) * pot.chi()) / RMath.RAY
      : pot.chi();

    // total pooled DAI is the total shares times the chi
    return (_totalPotShares * chi) / RMath.RAY;
  }
  function _deposit(address _to, uint256 _daiAmount) internal returns (uint256 shares) {
    // Check if the deposit cap is reached
    if (depositCap > 0 && _getTotalPooledDai().add(_daiAmount) > depositCap) {
      revert LSDai__DepositCap();
    }

    uint256 chi = _getMostRecentChi();

    // Calculate the amount of pot shares to mint
    uint256 potSharesAmount = RMath.rdiv(_daiAmount, chi);

    // Mint the shares to the user
    shares = getSharesByPooledDai(_daiAmount);
    _mintShares(_to, shares);

    // Increase the total amount of DAI pooled
    _totalPooledDai = _totalPooledDai.add(_daiAmount);
    // Keep track of total pot shares controlled by LSDAI
    _totalPotShares = _totalPotShares.add(potSharesAmount);

    // Mint LSDAI at 1:1 ratio to DAI
    emit Transfer(address(0), _to, _daiAmount);

    // Join the DSR on behalf of the user
    daiJoin.join(address(this), _daiAmount);
    pot.join(potSharesAmount);
  }

  function _withdraw(address _from, address _to, uint256 _daiAmount, uint256 _withdrawFee) internal returns (bool) {
    uint256 currentDaiBalance = balanceOf(_from);
    // Check if the user has enough LSDAI
    if (_daiAmount > currentDaiBalance) {
      revert LSDai__AmountExceedsBalance();
    }
    uint256 chi = _getMostRecentChi();

    // Split the amount into the fee and the actual withdrawal
    uint256 feeAmount = _daiAmount.mul(_withdrawFee).div(10_000);
    // Amount going to the user
    uint256 withdrawAmount = _daiAmount.sub(feeAmount);

    // Transfer the fee shares to fee recipient
    // and burn the withdraw shares from the user
    uint256 feeShares = getSharesByPooledDai(feeAmount);
    uint256 withdrawShares = getSharesByPooledDai(withdrawAmount);

    // Decrease the total amount of DAI pooled
    _totalPooledDai = _totalPooledDai.sub(withdrawAmount);

    _transferShares(_from, feeRecipient, feeShares);
    _burnShares(_from, withdrawShares);

    // Withdraw from the DSR, roudning up ensures we get at least the amount of DAI requested
    uint256 withdrawPotShares = RMath.rdivup(withdrawAmount, chi);
    // Reduce the total pot shares controlled by LSDAI
    _totalPotShares = _totalPotShares.sub(withdrawPotShares);

    // Burn LSDAI at 1:1 ratio to DAI
    emit Transfer(_from, address(0), withdrawAmount);

    // Get back the DAI from the DSR to the contract
    pot.exit(withdrawPotShares);

    daiJoin.exit(address(this), withdrawAmount); // wad is in dai units

    // Send it over
    return dai.transfer(_to, withdrawAmount);
  }

Now that I have given you the necessary information, I want you to help me find new gas-wasting patterns from the above codes, based on what you learn from the list of patterns. Please be creative and think out of the box beyond the patterns listed above. Please put the new gas wasting patterns in bullet points (in the form of '1.', '2.', etc), and answer the following questions for each of the found patterns (in sub-bullet-points under each bullet point):

1. How did you find this pattern? Could you explain the reasoning process, step by step, behind the discovery?

2. What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns? Could you explain the reasoning process, step by step, behind the reason why such a fix works?

3. On a score of 0 to 5, could you please tell me how would you rate this found new pattern, in terms of how much it is sacrificing readability, security, and maintainability in exchange for gas optimization (5 is the least impacted. For example, Security score of 5 means implementing the found gas-optimization pattern would have no effect on security, whereas 1 means it would reduce security)? Please format your answer as in "Readability: 5; Security: 4; Maintainability: 3". Please also provide explanations.

Here are some additional requirements:
1. If you think my prompt to you has any issues (e.g. ambiguity or lack of information), please tell me how I should improve it in the next time.
2. please help me format your answer in the form of a Latex section (e.g. \section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}), since I want to assert it to a Latex document.
