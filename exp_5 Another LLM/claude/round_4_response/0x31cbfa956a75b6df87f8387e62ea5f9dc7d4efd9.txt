\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

After reviewing the provided Solidity code and gas-wasting patterns, I have identified the following potential new gas-wasting patterns:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Redundant struct unpacking:} In the \texttt{tokenAmountsToLiquidity} function, the \texttt{positions} struct is unpacked into multiple variables, but only \texttt{tickLower} and \texttt{tickUpper} are used. Similarly, the \texttt{slot0} struct is unpacked, but only \texttt{sqrtPriceX96} is used. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Discovery process:} I noticed that the function unpacks structs into many variables, but only uses a few of them. This seemed inefficient and potentially wasteful.
        \item \textbf{Fix:} Instead of unpacking the entire struct, only extract the required fields. For example, replace \texttt{(, , , , , int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper, , , , , ) = positionManager.positions(uniV3Nft);} with \texttt{(int24 tickLower, int24 tickUpper) = positionManager.positions(uniV3Nft).extractFields();}, where \texttt{extractFields()} is a custom function that returns only the needed fields. This avoids unnecessary memory allocation and copying.
        \item \textbf{Ratings:} Readability: 4 (slightly less readable due to custom function); Security: 5 (no impact); Maintainability: 4 (requires maintaining the custom function).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Repeated external calls:} In the \texttt{calculateTvlByMinMaxPrices} function, \texttt{PositionValue.principal} is called twice with different arguments. External calls are expensive and should be minimized.
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item \textbf{Discovery process:} I looked for repeated function calls, especially external ones, that could potentially be optimized by caching results or combining calls.
        \item \textbf{Fix:} Cache the results of the first \texttt{principal} call and reuse them for the second call. For example, replace the two calls with: \texttt{(uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = PositionValue.principal(positionManager, uniV3Nft, minSqrtPriceX96);} and \texttt{(amountMax0, amountMax1) = amount0 > amount1 ? (amount1, amount0) : (amount0, amount1);} This avoids the second external call.
        \item \textbf{Ratings:} Readability: 4 (slightly less readable due to caching logic); Security: 5 (no impact); Maintainability: 4 (requires understanding the caching logic).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Inefficient price calculation:} In the \texttt{calculateCakePriceX96InUnderlying} function, the price is calculated using \texttt{sqrtPriceX96 * sqrtPriceX96 / Q96}, which involves a multiplication and a division. This could potentially be optimized.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Discovery process:} I examined the mathematical operations in the code, looking for potential optimizations based on the properties of the values involved.
        \item \textbf{Fix:} Since \texttt{Q96} is a constant (2^96), the division could be replaced with a bitwise right shift: \texttt{priceX96 = (sqrtPriceX96 * sqrtPriceX96) >> 96;}. This is cheaper than division.
        \item \textbf{Ratings:} Readability: 3 (bitwise operations are less intuitive); Security: 5 (no impact); Maintainability: 4 (requires understanding bitwise operations).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Regarding your prompt, it was clear and provided sufficient information for me to understand the task and context. The only potential improvement would be to clarify whether you're looking for gas optimizations specific to the provided code or more general patterns that could apply to any Solidity code.
