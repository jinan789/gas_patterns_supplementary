\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

After analyzing the provided Solidity code and considering the known gas-wasting patterns, here are a few potential new gas-wasting patterns I have identified:

1. Repeated storage reads in a loop:
   - In the \texttt{\_pendingTokens} function, the \texttt{rewardInfo} array is accessed multiple times within the loop. Each access to a storage variable incurs a gas cost. Instead, the \texttt{rewardInfo} array could be cached in memory before the loop to avoid repeated storage reads.
   - Reasoning process:
     1. Observed that the \texttt{rewardInfo} array is accessed within the loop.
     2. Recognized that storage reads are expensive and can be optimized.
     3. Considered caching the array in memory to reduce storage reads.
   - Fix:
     1. Declare a memory variable to store the \texttt{rewardInfo} array before the loop.
     2. Use the memory variable instead of directly accessing \texttt{rewardInfo} within the loop.
     3. This reduces the number of storage reads and saves gas.
   - Scores:
     - Readability: 4 (slightly reduced due to the additional memory variable)
     - Security: 5 (no impact on security)
     - Maintainability: 4 (slightly reduced due to the added complexity of caching)

2. Redundant calculations in a loop:
   - In the \texttt{\_onReward} function, the expression \texttt{(user.amount * uint256(reward.accTokenPerShare)) / ACC\_TOKEN\_PRECISION} is calculated multiple times within the loop. This calculation could be moved outside the loop and stored in a variable to avoid redundant computations.
   - Reasoning process:
     1. Identified the repeated calculation within the loop.
     2. Recognized that the calculation does not change within each iteration.
     3. Considered moving the calculation outside the loop to save gas.
   - Fix:
     1. Calculate the expression before the loop and store it in a variable.
     2. Use the pre-calculated variable within the loop.
     3. This eliminates redundant calculations and saves gas.
   - Scores:
     - Readability: 4 (slightly reduced due to the additional variable)
     - Security: 5 (no impact on security)
     - Maintainability: 4 (slightly reduced due to the added complexity)

3. Inefficient use of memory arrays:
   - In the \texttt{\_pendingTokens} function, a new memory array \texttt{rewards} is created with a length equal to \texttt{rewardInfo.length}. However, the size of the array is known at compile-time and could be declared with a fixed size to save gas.
   - Reasoning process:
     1. Noticed the creation of a new memory array with a dynamic length.
     2. Recognized that the array size is known at compile-time.
     3. Considered declaring the array with a fixed size to save gas.
   - Fix:
     1. Declare the \texttt{rewards} array with a fixed size based on the known length of \texttt{rewardInfo}.
     2. This avoids the gas cost associated with dynamic memory allocation.
   - Scores:
     - Readability: 5 (no significant impact on readability)
     - Security: 5 (no impact on security)
     - Maintainability: 4 (slightly reduced due to the fixed array size)

Regarding the prompt, it provides a good overview of gas optimization in Solidity and a list of known gas-wasting patterns. However, it would be helpful to include more specific details about the contract's functionality and any constraints or requirements that should be considered during the analysis. Additionally, providing a complete contract code would allow for a more comprehensive analysis.
