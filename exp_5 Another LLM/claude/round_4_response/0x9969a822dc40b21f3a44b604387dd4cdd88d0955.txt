\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

After studying the provided list of known gas-wasting patterns and analyzing the given Solidity code, I have identified the following potential new gas-wasting patterns:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Repeated storage reads in a function:} In the \texttt{\_redeemInternal} function, the expression \texttt{rEthToken.balanceOf(address(this))} is called twice - once to calculate the \texttt{sharesToRedeem} variable in \texttt{\_redeemFromProtocol} and again to calculate the \texttt{bought} variable. Repeated reads from storage can be expensive.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Discovery process:} I noticed the duplicate storage read while tracing the flow of data through the \texttt{\_redeemFromProtocol} and \texttt{\_redeemInternal} functions. Recalling that storage reads are expensive, and spotting the repeated read, led me to identify this as a potential gas optimization.
        \item \textbf{Fix:} Store the result of \texttt{rEthToken.balanceOf(address(this))} in a variable before the \texttt{\_resetAndApprove} call in \texttt{\_redeemInternal}, and use that variable to calculate \texttt{bought}. This avoids the second storage read.
        \item \textbf{Ratings:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Readability: 4 (Adding a new variable slightly reduces readability but the logic is still clear)
            \item Security: 5 (This change does not impact security)  
            \item Maintainability: 4 (The additional variable slightly increases complexity but not significantly)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Repeated array creation in \_depositInternal and \_redeemInternal:} In the \texttt{\_depositInternal} and \texttt{\_redeemInternal} functions, when \texttt{\_isViewExecution()} is true, a new uint256 array \texttt{depositSlippages} or \texttt{withdrawalSlippages} is created. This array creation happens on every call and could potentially be moved outside the function.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Discovery process:} While reviewing the code, I noticed that these arrays are created inside the functions, even though their size is always the same (4). This led me to consider if they could be moved outside to avoid repeated creation costs.
        \item \textbf{Fix:} Declare \texttt{depositSlippages} and \texttt{withdrawalSlippages} as storage variables in the contract, and use them instead of creating new arrays in the functions. Initialize them in the constructor. This moves the array creation cost to contract deployment, which only happens once.
        \item \textbf{Ratings:}
        \begin{itemize} 
            \item Readability: 3 (Using storage variables makes the code a bit harder to follow, as their initial values are set elsewhere)
            \item Security: 4 (Low impact, but using storage variables introduces a slight risk if they're inadvertently modified somewhere else) 
            \item Maintainability: 3 (Need to ensure these storage variables are correctly initialized and not unintentionally modified, adding maintenance overhead)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Regarding your prompt, it provides a good amount of context and clear instructions. One potential improvement could be to provide more details on the specific Solidity version and EVM environment you're targeting, as gas optimizations can sometimes depend on these specifics.
