Here is my analysis of the provided Solidity code, formatted as a LaTeX section:

\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

After reviewing the provided Solidity code and based on the known gas-wasting patterns, I have identified the following additional potential gas optimization opportunities:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Repeated storage reads in a loop:} In the \texttt{getStakedNftCount} function, there are multiple calls to \texttt{nft\_.stakerOf} and \texttt{nft\_.tokenOfOwnerByIndex} inside loops. These are storage reads which could be expensive if done repeatedly. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Discovery process:} I noticed that the \texttt{getStakedNftCount} function contains two loops, and within each loop, storage variables are being read multiple times. This reminded me of the "Expensive operations in a loop" pattern from the provided list, but applied specifically to storage reads.

\item \textbf{Fix:} To optimize this, you could consider caching the results of \texttt{nft\_.stakerOf} and \texttt{nft\_.tokenOfOwnerByIndex} in memory variables before the loop, and then referencing those memory variables inside the loop. This would reduce the number of storage reads.

\item \textbf{Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4} \\
Explanation: Caching storage reads in memory variables would slightly reduce readability and maintainability as it adds a bit more code. However, it should have no impact on security, and the readability/maintainability impact is minimal.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Inefficient struct usage:} The \texttt{PoolState} and \texttt{PendingRewards} structs are only used as return values in functions. Returning a struct from a function can be more expensive than returning individual values.

\begin{itemize} 
\item \textbf{Discovery process:} I noticed that the \texttt{viewPool} and \texttt{viewPoolPendingRewards} functions return structs. I then considered whether these structs are necessary or if the functions could return individual values instead. This thought process was inspired by the "Struct variable refactoring" pattern.

\item \textbf{Fix:} Consider refactoring the functions to return individual values instead of structs. For example, \texttt{viewPool} could return multiple values like \texttt{(uint256 coinPoolPendingApeCoin, uint256 coinPoolPendingRewards, ...)}. 

\item \textbf{Readability: 3; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3} \\
Explanation: Returning individual values instead of structs can make the function signatures more verbose and slightly harder to read and maintain. However, it should not impact security.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Duplicate logic:} The logic for calculating \texttt{coinRewards} is duplicated multiple times in \texttt{viewPoolPendingRewards}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Discovery process:} I noticed that the \texttt{viewPoolPendingRewards} function contains similar logic for \texttt{bayc}, \texttt{mayc}, and \texttt{bakc}. This duplicate logic could potentially be refactored into a separate function. 

\item \textbf{Fix:} Consider extracting the duplicate logic into a separate internal function that takes \texttt{rewards} and the NFT address as parameters. This function could then be called for each NFT type.

\item \textbf{Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4} \\
Explanation: Extracting duplicate logic into a separate function would improve readability and maintainability by reducing code duplication. It should have no impact on security.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Prompt Feedback:}
The prompt provides a good amount of context and examples of known gas-wasting patterns. One potential improvement could be to provide more specific guidance on what kind of new patterns to look for. For example, you could ask to focus on patterns related to storage, loops, or function returns. This would help narrow down the scope and provide more direction for the analysis.
