\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

After analyzing the provided Solidity code and considering the known gas-wasting patterns, I have identified the following new potential gas-wasting patterns:

1. Redundant storage reads and writes in loop:
   - In the `gen1IndividualUnstake` and `gen2IndividualUnstake` functions, there are redundant storage reads and writes inside the loop when searching for the token index. The `gen1StakedArray[msg.sender]` and `gen2StakedArray[msg.sender]` arrays are accessed multiple times within the loop, leading to unnecessary gas consumption.
   - To fix this, you can store the array in a memory variable before the loop and use the memory variable inside the loop. This reduces the number of storage reads and writes.
   - Readability: 4 (slightly reduced due to the introduction of a memory variable); Security: 5 (no impact on security); Maintainability: 4 (slightly reduced due to the additional memory variable).

2. Inefficient array searching:
   - In the `gen1IndividualUnstake` and `gen2IndividualUnstake` functions, the code searches for the token index by iterating through the entire array. This approach has a linear time complexity and can be gas-intensive for large arrays.
   - To optimize this, you can consider using a mapping to store the token index directly. This allows for constant-time access to the index, reducing gas costs.
   - Readability: 3 (using a mapping may make the code slightly less intuitive); Security: 5 (no impact on security); Maintainability: 4 (slightly reduced due to the additional mapping).

3. Repeated code blocks:
   - The `gen1IndividualStake`, `gen2IndividualStake`, `gen1IndividualUnstake`, and `gen2IndividualUnstake` functions have similar code structures and logic. Repeating similar code blocks can lead to increased deployment costs.
   - To optimize this, you can consider extracting the common logic into separate internal functions or modifiers. This reduces code duplication and saves gas during deployment.
   - Readability: 4 (extracting common logic improves code organization); Security: 5 (no impact on security); Maintainability: 5 (improved maintainability due to reduced code duplication).

4. Inefficient arithmetic operations:
   - In the `getArtifactForGen1` function, there are multiple divisions performed using the `period` variable. Division operations are generally more expensive than multiplication or addition.
   - To optimize this, you can consider precalculating the reciprocal of `period` and using multiplication instead of division. This can save gas costs for repeated calculations.
   - Readability: 3 (using reciprocals may make the code less intuitive); Security: 5 (no impact on security); Maintainability: 4 (slightly reduced due to the additional precalculation step).

Improvements to the prompt:
- The prompt provides a good list of known gas-wasting patterns and a clear set of instructions for finding new patterns. However, it would be helpful to have more context about the overall purpose and functionality of the provided Solidity code. This additional context could assist in identifying gas-wasting patterns that are specific to the contract's intended behavior.
