\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

After analyzing the provided Solidity code, I have identified the following new gas-wasting patterns:

1. Repeated storage reads and writes in loops:
   - In the `_creditTill` function, the `storedCredits` mapping is accessed multiple times within the loop. Each access to a storage variable incurs gas costs. Instead of repeatedly accessing the storage variable, it could be cached in memory at the beginning of the function and updated only once at the end.
   - Fix:
     1. Declare a memory variable to store the `StoredCredit` struct at the beginning of the function.
     2. Update the memory variable within the loop instead of directly updating `storedCredits`.
     3. Update the `storedCredits` mapping with the final value of the memory variable at the end of the function.
   - Reasoning: Caching the storage variable in memory reduces the number of storage reads and writes, resulting in gas savings.
   - Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4
     - Explanation: Caching the storage variable in memory slightly reduces readability but has no impact on security. Maintainability is slightly affected as it requires additional variables and updates.

2. Redundant checks in loops:
   - In the `_send` function, the `require(_tokenIds.length > 0)` check is performed before the loop. However, if the loop is entered, it implicitly means that `_tokenIds.length` is greater than 0. The check can be removed to save gas.
   - Fix:
     1. Remove the `require(_tokenIds.length > 0)` check before the loop.
   - Reasoning: If the loop is entered, it guarantees that `_tokenIds.length` is greater than 0, making the explicit check redundant.
   - Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5
     - Explanation: Removing the redundant check improves readability, has no impact on security, and maintains the same level of maintainability.

3. Inefficient event emission:
   - The `SendToChain` and `ReceiveFromChain` events are emitted with individual `_tokenIds` elements. Emitting events with arrays can be gas-intensive, especially for large arrays. Consider emitting a single event with a hash of the `_tokenIds` array instead.
   - Fix:
     1. Calculate the hash of the `_tokenIds` array using a hashing function (e.g., `keccak256`).
     2. Emit the event with the hash instead of the entire array.
   - Reasoning: Emitting events with large arrays consumes significant gas. By emitting a hash of the array, gas costs can be reduced while still providing a reference to the original data.
   - Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4
     - Explanation: Emitting a hash instead of the array slightly reduces readability, as the original data is not directly available in the event. However, it has no impact on security. Maintainability is slightly affected, as the original data needs to be stored separately and mapped to the emitted hash.

Regarding your prompt, it provides sufficient information and context for analyzing the Solidity code. However, you could consider providing more specific guidelines or areas of focus for finding gas-wasting patterns, if desired.
