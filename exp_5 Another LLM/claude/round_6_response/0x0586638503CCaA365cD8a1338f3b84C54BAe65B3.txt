\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

Here are some potential new gas-wasting patterns I identified in the provided Solidity code, along with answers to your questions for each pattern:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inefficient use of \texttt{require} statements
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The code uses \texttt{require} statements to check for the zero address in both the \texttt{transferFrom} and \texttt{\_transferFrom} functions. Since \texttt{transferFrom} calls \texttt{\_transferFrom}, these checks are redundant. The reasoning is that any check performed in the calling function doesn't need to be repeated in the called function.
        \item To fix this, remove the \texttt{require} statements checking for the zero address from the \texttt{\_transferFrom} function. The checks in \texttt{transferFrom} are sufficient.
        \item Readability: 4 (slightly less readable due to removed checks); Security: 5 (no impact since the checks are still performed); Maintainability: 4 (slightly improved as redundant code is removed).
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Unnecessary calculations in \texttt{tokenSwap}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The \texttt{tokenSwap} function calculates \texttt{totalETHFee} even though it's only used for proportional calculations. Dividing by \texttt{getTotalTax()} instead would have the same effect and save gas by avoiding the extra subtractions. The reasoning is that proportional calculations don't change when both numerator and denominator are divided by the same value.
        \item Replace divisions by \texttt{totalETHFee} with divisions by \texttt{getTotalTax()}. For example, change \texttt{amountETH.mul(\_devBuyTax + \_devSellTax).div(totalETHFee)} to \texttt{amountETH.mul(\_devBuyTax + \_devSellTax).div(getTotalTax())}.
        \item Readability: 4 (slightly less intuitive); Security: 5 (no impact); Maintainability: 4 (slightly harder to understand the intent).
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Redundant initialization of \texttt{tmpSuccess}
    \begin{enumerate} 
        \item The variable \texttt{tmpSuccess} is initialized to \texttt{false} after some calls, but this is unnecessary because the value is never used. The reasoning is that initializing an unused variable wastes gas.
        \item Remove the lines that set \texttt{tmpSuccess = false;} after the \texttt{call} statements.
        \item Readability: 5 (improves readability by removing pointless code); Security: 5 (no impact); Maintainability: 5 (improves maintainability by removing dead code).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Regarding your prompt, it was clear and provided sufficient information to analyze the code for gas optimizations. The only potential improvement could be specifying which version of Solidity the code is written for, as gas optimizations can vary between versions.
