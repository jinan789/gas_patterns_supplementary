\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

After studying the provided list of known gas-wasting patterns in Solidity and carefully analyzing the provided code snippet, I have identified the following additional potential gas-wasting patterns:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Unnecessary use of \texttt{.sub()} and \texttt{.add()} for uint256:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item I found this pattern by noticing the frequent use of \texttt{.sub()} and \texttt{.add()} for \texttt{uint256} variables throughout the code, even though uint256 is an unsigned integer that cannot be negative. Using these functions adds unnecessary gas costs.
        \item To fix this, simply use the \texttt{-} and \texttt{+} operators instead of \texttt{.sub()} and \texttt{.add()} when dealing with \texttt{uint256} variables. The compiler will handle underflow/overflow checks appropriately.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Inefficient use of \texttt{require()} statements:}
    \begin{itemize} 
        \item I noticed that some \texttt{require()} statements involve complex expressions that could be broken down into simpler checks. Evaluating complex expressions in \texttt{require()} statements consumes extra gas.
        \item To optimize this, break down complex \texttt{require()} expressions into multiple simpler \texttt{require()} statements. This allows the contract to fail faster if an early check is not met, saving gas on unnecessary further computations.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Duplicate logic in \texttt{compound()} and \texttt{internalDeposit()}:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \texttt{compound()} function calls \texttt{internalDeposit()} with the amount of new tokens received. However, \texttt{internalDeposit()} performs a check that is always true in this context, since the new tokens are already added to the balance.
        \item To fix this, consider adding a flag parameter to \texttt{internalDeposit()} to conditionally skip the balance check when called from \texttt{compound()}, avoiding the unnecessary computation.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Inefficient calculation in \texttt{swapAndLiquify()}:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The \texttt{swapAndLiquify()} function calculates \texttt{\_denominator} using the total fees, and then calculates the individual fee amounts using division. However, integer division truncates the results, potentially leading to leftover ETH in the contract.
        \item To optimize this, consider calculating the individual fee amounts first using multiplication and then summing them up to get the total. This ensures that all the ETH is accurately distributed among the receivers without leftovers due to truncation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Regarding your prompt, it provided a clear list of known gas-wasting patterns and a relevant code snippet to analyze. The only suggestion I have is to potentially include more context about the contract's purpose and overall architecture, as that could help in identifying gas optimizations that are specific to the contract's intended behavior.
