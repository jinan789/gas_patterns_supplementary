\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

After analyzing the provided Solidity code, I have identified the following potential gas-wasting patterns:

1. Unnecessary comparison to boolean values in the `canSendTokens` function:
   - How did you find this pattern? In the `canSendTokens` function, there are comparisons like `isZero` and `hasSendingTokens` that are compared to boolean values (`true` or `false`). However, these variables are already boolean values themselves, so comparing them to `true` or `false` is redundant and wastes gas.
   - How to fix:
     1. Remove the unnecessary comparisons to boolean values.
     2. Use the boolean variables directly in the conditional statements.
   - Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5
     Explanation: Removing the unnecessary comparisons improves readability and maintainability by simplifying the code. It has no impact on security.

2. Repeated calculations of total fees in the `updateBuyFees` and `updateSellFees` functions:
   - How did you find this pattern? In both functions, the total fees are calculated by summing up the individual fee components. However, this calculation is performed even if the total fees exceed the maximum allowed value (3%). The calculation could be avoided if the check is performed before updating the individual fee variables.
   - How to fix:
     1. Calculate the total fees before updating the individual fee variables.
     2. Check if the total fees exceed the maximum allowed value.
     3. If the total fees are within the allowed range, update the individual fee variables.
   - Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4
     Explanation: Moving the total fee calculation and check before updating the individual fee variables slightly reduces readability but improves gas efficiency. It has no impact on security and slightly improves maintainability by avoiding unnecessary calculations.

3. Inefficient use of `uint256` for small values:
   - How did you find this pattern? In the `updateMarketingWallet` function, the `newWallet` address is checked against the zero address using `address(0)`. However, converting `0` to an address type is unnecessary and wastes gas.
   - How to fix:
     1. Replace `address(0)` with the `address` literal `0x0`.
   - Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5
     Explanation: Using the `address` literal `0x0` instead of `address(0)` improves gas efficiency without sacrificing readability, security, or maintainability.

4. Redundant zero initialization:
   - How did you find this pattern? In the `swapBack` function, variables like `tokensForMarketing`, `tokensForDev`, `tokensForSending`, and `tokensForLiquidity` are explicitly set to zero. However, Solidity automatically initializes variables to their default values (zero for uint256), so explicitly setting them to zero is redundant and wastes gas.
   - How to fix:
     1. Remove the explicit zero initializations for these variables.
   - Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5
     Explanation: Removing the redundant zero initializations improves gas efficiency without impacting readability, security, or maintainability.

Regarding the prompt, it provides sufficient information and context to analyze the Solidity code for gas optimization. However, providing more specific examples or scenarios could help in identifying additional gas-wasting patterns.
