\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

After analyzing the provided Solidity code and considering the known gas-wasting patterns, I have identified a few potential areas for optimization:

1. Repeated storage reads in loops: In the \texttt{getStakedNftCount} function, there are two loops that iterate over the user's NFTs and perform storage reads (\texttt{stakerOf}, \texttt{tokenOfOwnerByIndex}) inside the loop. These storage reads are expensive and can be optimized.

   \begin{itemize}
   \item I found this pattern by observing the loops in the \texttt{getStakedNftCount} function and noticing the storage reads inside the loops, which is similar to the "Expensive operations in a loop" pattern mentioned in the provided list.
   
   \item To fix this, you can consider caching the required data in memory before the loop and then using the cached values inside the loop. For example, you can store the user's NFT balances and token IDs in memory arrays before the loops and then use those arrays inside the loops to avoid repeated storage reads.
   
   \item Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4 \\
   Explanation: Caching the data in memory may slightly reduce readability, but it should not have a significant impact on security or maintainability. The logic remains the same, and the optimization is straightforward to implement.
   \end{itemize}

2. Redundant calculations in \texttt{viewUserPendingRewards}: The \texttt{viewUserPendingRewards} function calls \texttt{viewPoolPendingRewards} to get the total pool rewards and then calculates the user's share of rewards for each pool. However, if the user has no staked NFTs or coin pool balance, the calculations are unnecessary.

   \begin{itemize}
   \item I found this pattern by analyzing the \texttt{viewUserPendingRewards} function and noticing that it performs calculations even when the user has no stake in a particular pool, which is similar to the "Opaque predicate" pattern mentioned in the provided list.
   
   \item To fix this, you can add conditional checks before each reward calculation to skip the calculation if the user has no stake in the corresponding pool. For example, before calculating \texttt{rewards.coinPoolRewards}, check if \texttt{coinPool.balanceOf(userAddr\_)} is zero and skip the calculation if true.
   
   \item Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5 \\
   Explanation: Adding conditional checks improves readability by making the code more explicit and avoiding unnecessary calculations. It has no impact on security and may slightly improve maintainability by reducing the chances of errors related to zero-stake scenarios.
   \end{itemize}

3. Duplicate logic in \texttt{viewBakcPairingStatus}: The \texttt{viewBakcPairingStatus} function has two separate loops that iterate over \texttt{baycTokenIds\_} and \texttt{maycTokenIds\_} respectively, but the logic inside the loops is similar.

   \begin{itemize}
   \item I found this pattern by observing the two loops in the \texttt{viewBakcPairingStatus} function and noticing the similar logic inside the loops, which is not exactly the same as the provided patterns but shares similarities with the "Loop fusion" pattern.
   
   \item To fix this, you can consider merging the two loops into a single loop that iterates over the combined length of both arrays. Inside the loop, you can use conditional statements to determine whether to process a BAYC or MAYC token ID based on the current index.
   
   \item Readability: 3; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4 \\
   Explanation: Merging the loops may slightly reduce readability as the code becomes more complex with conditional statements. However, it should not impact security, and maintainability is only slightly affected as the overall logic remains the same.
   \end{itemize}

Regarding the prompt, it provides a good amount of information and context for analyzing the gas-wasting patterns. One potential improvement could be to provide more specific guidelines on what constitutes a "new" pattern and how creative or out-of-the-box the answers should be. Additionally, you could clarify whether the focus should be solely on gas optimization or if other factors like readability and security should be given equal consideration.
