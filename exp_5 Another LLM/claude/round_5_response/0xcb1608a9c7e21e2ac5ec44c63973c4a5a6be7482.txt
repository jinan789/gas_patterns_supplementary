\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

Here are some potential new gas-wasting patterns I identified in the provided Solidity code, along with answers to your follow-up questions:

1. Redundant checks in the \texttt{canSwapTokens} function. 
   \begin{itemize}
      \item I noticed that the \texttt{canSwapTokens} function performs the check \texttt{hasSwappingTokens} (which is equivalent to \texttt{tokensForSwapping > 0}) in addition to \texttt{moreThanSwappingTokens} (which is \texttt{balanceOf(self) >= tokensForSwapping}). However, \texttt{moreThanSwappingTokens} already implies \texttt{hasSwappingTokens}, so the latter check is redundant.
      \item To fix this, simply remove the redundant \texttt{hasSwappingTokens} check. The reasoning is that if \texttt{balanceOf(self) >= tokensForSwapping}, then \texttt{tokensForSwapping} must be greater than 0, so we don't need to check that separately.
      \item Readability: 5 (removing redundant code improves readability); Security: 5 (no impact); Maintainability: 5 (simpler code is easier to maintain). 
   \end{itemize}

2. Unnecessary temporary variable in \texttt{canSwapTokens}.
   \begin{itemize} 
      \item The \texttt{canSwapTokens} function assigns the result of comparisons to a temporary variable \texttt{result}, but in the \texttt{excludedFromFees} branch, it immediately returns the value of \texttt{result}. Storing the result in a temporary variable is unnecessary.
      \item To optimize this, directly return the result of the comparisons instead of assigning to \texttt{result} first. For example, change \texttt{result = false; return result;} to just \texttt{return false;}.
      \item Readability: 4 (slightly more concise); Security: 5 (no impact); Maintainability: 4 (fewer lines of code).
   \end{itemize}

3. Repeated arithmetic in fee calculations.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item The \texttt{updateBuyFees} and \texttt{updateSellFees} functions calculate the total fees by summing the individual fee components. However, this arithmetic is repeated in the \texttt{require} statement that checks if the total fees exceed 3\%. 
      \item To avoid repeating the arithmetic, store the total fees in a variable before the \texttt{require} check. For example: \texttt{uint256 newTotalBuyFees = marketingFee + devFee + swapFee + liquidityFee; require(newTotalBuyFees <= 3, "3\% max"); totalBuyFees = newTotalBuyFees;}.
      \item Readability: 4 (adds a new variable but avoids repetition); Security: 5 (no impact); Maintainability: 4 (avoids duplicated arithmetic).
   \end{itemize}

Regarding your prompt, it provides sufficient context and examples for me to understand the task. One suggestion for improvement could be to clarify whether you want me to focus solely on gas optimization or if I should also consider readability, security, and maintainability trade-offs in my analysis.
