### New Gas-Wasting Patterns Discovered

#### 1. Unoptimized Conditional Checks
- **Pattern Description**: In the provided code, there are multiple conditional checks that compare `new_locked.end` and `old_locked.end` to `block.timestamp`, as well as to each other. These checks are repeated multiple times, which leads to redundant computation and gas wastage.
- **Discovery Process**:
  1. Reviewed the code to identify repeated patterns or operations.
  2. Noticed the repeated condition checks involving `new_locked.end`, `old_locked.end`, and `block.timestamp`.
  3. Recognized that evaluating these conditions multiple times could be optimized by storing their results in temporary variables.
- **Fix Steps**:
  1. At the beginning of the function, evaluate these conditions once and store the results in temporary boolean variables.
  2. Use these boolean variables in the subsequent conditional checks throughout the function.
  3. This approach reduces the number of times these conditions are evaluated, thus saving gas.
- **Impact Rating**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. The changes maintain the original logic clarity and security while slightly altering the structure for better maintainability.

#### 2. Repeated Access of `block.timestamp` and `block.number`
- **Pattern Description**: The code accesses `block.timestamp` and `block.number` multiple times. Each access to these global variables consumes gas and can be optimized by storing their values in local variables at the start of the function.
- **Discovery Process**:
  1. Scanned the code for repeated global state accesses.
  2. Identified multiple accesses to `block.timestamp` and `block.number`.
  3. Realized that caching these values could save gas.
- **Fix Steps**:
  1. Declare local variables at the start of the function to store `block.timestamp` and `block.number`.
  2. Replace all instances of `block.timestamp` and `block.number` with these local variables in the function body.
  3. This change reduces the gas cost associated with repeatedly accessing these global variables.
- **Impact Rating**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This optimization has minimal impact on the code's readability, security, and maintainability.

### Improvements and Reflections

- **Prompt Clarity**: The prompt was well-structured and provided sufficient details for identifying gas-wasting patterns. However, it could include more specific examples of typical gas inefficiencies encountered in Vyper to guide the analysis further.
- **Reflection on Reasoning Process**:
  1. Initially, I focused predominantly on complex logic but missed simpler optimizations like caching frequently accessed variables.
  2. Incorporating a checklist of common gas inefficiencies, such as repeated global state access, could streamline the analysis and ensure no potential optimizations are overlooked.
  3. For future tasks, maintaining a balance between deep analysis of complex functions and straightforward optimizations will enhance efficiency and thoroughness.

- **Improvements Made**:
  1. I expanded the scope of analysis to include simple yet frequently overlooked optimizations, like caching global variables.
  2. Emphasized both logic-based optimizations and simpler, straightforward improvements to provide a comprehensive gas optimization strategy.

These adjustments and reflections aim to enhance the effectiveness and thoroughness of gas optimization in smart contract development, particularly for Vyper contracts.
