“Waited 365 days to launch this token” 

$365 is a unique and well prepared cryptocurrency project that brings a fresh take on the crypto market, embracing humor and patience in a typically fast-paced industry. What distinguishes $365 from its counterparts is its distinctive launch strategy; the project undertook a year-long wait before its official launch, hence the name $365. 

This method symbolizes a year of calculated patience and meticulous development, contrasting the typical "rush-to-market" strategy seen with many other cryptocurrencies. Rooted in the vibrant tradition of meme-based cryptocurrencies, $365 offers a blend of novelty and engagement, demonstrating the team's commitment to both the serious and playful aspects of the crypto world.

After 365 days of waiting it’s finally time to launch 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
